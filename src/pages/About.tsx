                <p className="text-foreground/90 mb-4">
                  Pauper Forge was created by a team of passionate Magic: The Gathering players who believed that everyone should have access to a wide variety of decks for casual play and collecting without breaking the bank.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 mb-4">
                  We understand that many iconic and powerful MTG decks can cost hundreds or even thousands of euros to build with original cards. Our mission is to provide high-quality proxies that allow players to experience these decks at an affordable price.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90">
                  All of our proxy decks are meticulously designed to look and feel as close to the original cards as possible, while being clearly marked as proxies for ethical play.
                </p>
